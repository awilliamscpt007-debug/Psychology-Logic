# Independent Research & Adversarial Logic 
**Focus:** Psychology, Systems Analysis, and Logical Deconstruction

## 🧠 Methodology: The "Thread-Mining" Process
My research process is built on **multi-threaded data synthesis**. I deconstruct complex psychological concepts into "atomic truths" to test for logical consistency.

- **Phase 1: Information Gathering:** Aggregating data across 100+ sources/threads to identify consensus and outliers.
- **Phase 2: Atomic Deconstruction:** Breaking down theories (e.g., Cognitive Dissonance or Systems Theory) into their smallest verifiable components.
- **Phase 3: Stress Testing:** Applying adversarial logic to find "hallucinations" or flaws in the reasoning.

## 🛠 Projects & Deep Dives
### Quantifying Subjective Giftedness & Diagnostic Bias
*   **Objective:** Analyzing the correlation between high-range IQ (140–160+) and behavioral misidentification (e.g., ADHD misdiagnosis).
*   **Method:** Deconstructing developmental milestones to identify non-obvious indicators of giftedness that bypass standard diagnostic filters.
*   **AI Application:** Experience in identifying how rigid classification systems (like LLM labeling) can fail when encountering high-variance data points.

## 💻 Technical Growth
- **Languages:** Python (Foundational via Codecademy & [PCEP-30-02] PCEP™ – Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer)
- **Frameworks:** Logic Mapping, Technical Writing, Data Annotation

## Current Focus
- Focus: Heuristic Pattern Synthesis across Behavioral Systems.
