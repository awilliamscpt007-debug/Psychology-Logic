# Independent Research & Adversarial Logic 
**Focus:** Psychology, Systems Analysis, and Logical Deconstruction

## 🧠 Methodology: The "Thread-Mining" Process
My research process is built on **multi-threaded data synthesis**. I deconstruct complex psychological concepts into "atomic truths" to test for logical consistency.

- **Phase 1: Information Gathering:** Aggregating data across 100+ sources/threads to identify consensus and outliers.
- **Phase 2: Atomic Deconstruction:** Breaking down theories (e.g., Cognitive Dissonance or Systems Theory) into their smallest verifiable components.
- **Phase 3: Stress Testing:** Applying adversarial logic to find "hallucinations" or flaws in the reasoning.

## 🛠 Projects & Deep Dives
### [Project Name: e.g., Analyzing Bias in Behavioral Models]
*   **Objective:** To determine if X theory holds up under Y conditions.
*   **Tools:** Independent research, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) (Python for Data Science), and GitHub documentation.
*   **Outcome:** (Write 1-2 sentences on what you discovered).
