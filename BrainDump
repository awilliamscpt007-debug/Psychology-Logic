(Raw Brainstorming)
How are systems made? Are the parts made first and added to it or do you make the outline and fill in wht makes since?

I've started to realize with coding how powerful it can be to just deconstruct things. 
If I get the logic and work with the logic the little rules I forget and knowlege I need to look up can just be a part of my overall process of understanding the system, that's what makes it fun.
